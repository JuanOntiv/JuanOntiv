# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in process automation, software testing, and systems administration. I enjoy solving problems using tools like Python, Bash, and Git, and Iâ€™m currently exploring technologies such as Docker, Jenkins, and Ansible to optimize development and deployment workflows.
